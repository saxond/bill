## Getting started

I used this remix tutorial to get started:

https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/tutorial

At the "Validating Params and throwing responses" section I switched to the backend.

## Server

I used this page to create a template spring boot project:

    https://start.spring.io

Be sure to add dependencies and add the web components.  I called the artifact server, downloaded it, then unziped it:

    unzip ~/Downloads/server.zip

I copied the contacts data from the React project into the java project and added some code to load it into a repository.
